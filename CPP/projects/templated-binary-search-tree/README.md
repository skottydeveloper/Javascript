# Templated Binary Search Tree
## Summary
This code project is a C++ implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. The BST class has several public methods for inserting a new node, finding a node with a given key, deleting a node, rotating the tree right, getting the size of the tree, getting the root value, and printing the tree. The class also has several private helper methods, including fixing the height of nodes in the tree, deleting a subtree, finding the minimum node in a subtree, and printing a subtree. The implementation is done using templates to allow for different types of data to be stored in the tree. Overall, this code project provides a basic implementation of a BST data structure that can be used to store and manipulate data in a tree-like structure.
