## Summary
This repository is a portfolio of my best code written in the Java programming language. It consists of projects I have completed, during uni and in my own time - while learning Java.

### Image Manipulator

### SFX Application
Developed using JavaFX, along with a bit of CSS - the program's purpose is to allow an employer to login and manage a list of their employees. The list of employees can be modified, by the addition and removal of employees. The employer can also view his employees' details, such as their pay rate, superannuation, etc.
