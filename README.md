# Coding Projects
## Summary
This repository contains a collection of coding projects completed throughout my Software Engineering degree. The goal of this repository is to showcase my familiarity with core programming concepts, object-oriented design, and general problem-solving across multiple languages and approaches.

## Languages & Project Areas
- **C**: Foundational systems and memory-focused programming.
- **C++**: Data structures and algorithms implementation.
- **C#**: Console applications.
- **Java**: Data structures and obect-oriented programming.
- **JavaScript**: Front-end focused scripts and browser-based logic.

## Other Projects
In addition to the contents of this repository, I have also developed and published three **Swift**-based iOS applications, available on the App Store. These reflect my ability to build and ship complete mobile solutions independently.
